# AI for Trading Card Games

Building AI engines that can play trading card games at a high level.

## About

I'm documenting my work building AI agents for trading card games like Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone, and Lorcana. These games present some of the hardest challenges in game AI: imperfect information, massive action spaces, and complex rules engines.

I'm particularly interested in:
- **AI-assisted coding** for rapidly building game engines
- **Deep reinforcement learning** for creating strong agents through self-play
- **Advanced search methods** for handling imperfect information
